## [Accessibility Design](#)

### Accessible Gaming

Credit: This activity was adapted from @Maker_Mark and remixed by Karen Smith and Hive Toronto with permission. 

In this activity learners design and create gaming controllers with a focus on accessibility.

45 minutes to an hour

### Preparation

Assemble necessary equipment for this activity including Makey Makey kits (4-5 learners can share 1 kit), a laptop for each design team, and prototyping materials (paper, tape, scissors, markers, pencil, tinfoil, etc.). 

If you are new to Makey Makeys, review the Quick Start Guide http://www.makeymakey.com/howto.php

### Introduction 

Have a brief conversation with your learners about accessibility?

Look around the room or space where you are located. Are there any features that make it accessible?

What are some ways that the web gets built to be accessible so that more people can use it? 

Prompt your learners to consider different language communities, differing physical capabilities, etc..

### Accessible Game Controller Design Challenge

Break the group into small teams (3-5 learners are recommended)

Read the following design challenge to your group

> You have a friend named Mateo who has cerebral palsy. Mateo really enjoys challenging his friends to play online video games, but has difficulty using the computer keyboard. Mateo's  Aunt heard that some people are using Makey Makey invention kits to create unique game controllers that draw on the individual strengths that people have. Mateo's Aunt has provided you with a Makey Makey kit to make a game controller for Mateo as a surprise for his birthday. Mateo is able to make precise movements with his thumb and index finger on his right hand. His left hand is typically clenched in a fist and he can tilt his wrist and make bigger motions with this hand. Your challenge is to design a video game controller that will work for Mateo. The first game you'd like to play with Mateo is a maze game made in Scratch (https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/11710850/). 

Provide groups with 25 minutes to create a controller

### Demos

Have groups demonstrate their designs by playing the maze game and using their controllers

### Debrief Discussion

What were the challenges you had when designing your controller? 

What did you learn by designing a game controller for Mateo?

If you wanted to play a different kind of game, such as one where the avatar on screen runs and jumps, would your controller still work?  Why or why not?
